<h1>Example 1</h1>

	<section>
		<p class="example-intro">Two of the most commonly confused words are <b>affect</b> and <b>effect</b>. They may sound similar, but they actually mean very different things. <b>Affect</b> is a <i>verb</i> that means "to influence". <b>Effect</b> is a <i>noun</i> that means "result". One trick to keeping these two straight is to remember that affect is an action (they both start with A's!) while effect is a thing.</p>

		<h4 class="example example-sentence example-example">The <span class="red">affects</span> of the treatment were more positive than the team had originally hoped for.</h4>
		<p class="example example-explanation example-explanation">Here we see affects being used as a noun instead of a verb. Remember, affects with an "a" is always an action.</p>
		<h4 class="example example-corrected example-corrected">The <span class="green">effects</span> of the treatment were more positive than the team had originally hoped for.</h4>
		<p class="example corrected-explanation example-corrected-explanation">Now we're looking better! We've replaced the verb "affects" with the noun "effects", and corrected the sentence.</p>

<h1>Example 2</h1>

	<section>
		<p class="example-intro">Another set of commonly confused words are <b>insure</b>, <b>ensure</b> and <b>assure</b>. Because they are all verbs, part of speech won't help us determine which is correct, so we'll just need to remember the different meanings of each. To <b>insure</b> means "to protect against loss", to <b>ensure</b> means "to make certain", and to <b>assure</b> means "to give confidence". There aren't really any shortcuts here, you'll just have to commit them to memory! Check out the following examples. </p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4 class="example example-sentence example-example">It's up to every person in a healthcare environment to <span class="red">insure</span> that each patient gets the best care possible.</h4>
		<p class="example example-explanation example-explanation">At first glance you might think this one is correct, but be careful! What is the action being taken in this sentence? Aren't we trying to <i>make certain</i> that each patient gets the best care possible?</p>
		<h4 class="example example-corrected example-corrected">It's up to every person in a healthcare environment to <span class="green">ensure</span> that each patient gets the best care possible.</h4>
		<p class="example corrected-explanation example-corrected-explanation">That's more like it! Remember, to <b>insure</b> means to protect something against loss, whereas to <b>ensure</b> means to make certain of something.</p>

		<p class="example example-explanation example-explanation">This sentence incorrectly uses "ensure' in place of "assure". Remember that "assure" should be used in situations where the subject is trying to relieve another's doubts or assert something positively.</p>

<h1>Example 3</h1>

	<section>
		<p class="example-intro">Next up on our list of commonly confused words, <b>principal</b> and <b>principle</b>. Easily confused due to identical pronounciations, the two actually serve very different roles and have very different meanings. "Principal" is an adjective that is used to designate something as primary, or chief, or first-order, whereas "principle" is a noun that means a standard or value. Here's a few examples of how the confusion occurs.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4 class="example example-sentence example-example">Because of their proximity and the frequency of their visits, nurses will often become a patient's <span class="red">principle</span> resource.</h4>
		<p class="example example-explanation example-explanation">This sentence uses "principle" incorrectly. Instead of being used correctly as a noun, it is attached as an adjective to "resource". The role of adjective is served by "principal".</p>
		<h4 class="example example-corrected example-corrected">Because of their proximity and the frequency of their visits, nurses will often become a patient's <span class="green">principal</span> resource.</h4>
		<p class="example corrected-explanation example-corrected-explanation">Switch the two out, and the sentence is all cleaned up. If it's an adjective, use "principal" with an "a", if it's a noun, use "principle" with an "e". </p>

		<h4 class="example example-sentence example-example">Providing healthcare is an important and sensitive service, and all practitioners must hold themselves to certain ethical <span class="red">principals</span>.</h4>
		<p class="example example-explanation example-explanation">This sentence is the reverse of the above example. Here we use "principal" as a noun instead of an adjective. When we are talking about standards or values we are talking about "principles", not "principal".</p>

<h1>Example 4</h1>

	<section>
		<p class="example-intro">Our last set of commonly confused words are <b>except</b> and <b>accept</b>. The key to using these correctly is to remember their very different meanings. Except is used to signify that something is not included. It can be used as a preposition, a conjunction, or a verb. Accept is a verb that means "to recieve" or "to come to recognize something as valid".</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4 class="example example-sentence example-example">The patient adhered to the treatment plan <span class="red">accept</span> for the dietary restrictions</h4>
		<p class="example example-explanation example-explanation">Here the verb "accept" is used in place of the preposition "except". Accept should only be used as a verb meaning "to recieve" or "to recognize as true".</p>
		<h4 class="example example-corrected example-corrected">The patient adhered to the treatment plan <span class="green">except</span> for the dietary restricitons.</h4>
		<p class="example corrected-explanation example-corrected-explanation">Replace the verb accept with the preposition except, and our sentence is fixed. Always pay attention to the part of speech when trying to decide which of these two words to use.</p>

	<section>
		<h4 class="example example-sentence example-example">It is part of the nurses' job to help patients <span class="red">except</span> the difficult aspects of their treatment.</h4>
		<p class="example example-explanation example-explanation">This example is the opposite of the above. In this case we are trying to use "except" where we should instead be using "accept". Notice that our word is filling the role of the verb in our sentence, it is relaying the action that the nurse must help the patient with. In this case the nurse isn't helping the patient exclude the difficult aspects of their treatment, but rather helping them come to terms with the difficult aspects of their treatment. This is one of the most common uses of the verb "accept". </p>
		<h4 class="example example-sentence example-corrected">It is part of the nurses' job to help patients <span class="green">accept</span> the difficult aspects of their treatment.</h4>
		<p class="example corrected-explanation example-corrected-explanation">That's better. We've replaced the verb "except", which means "to exclude", with the verb "to accept", which in this case means "to come to terms with".</p>
